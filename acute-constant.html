      <h3>Acute and Constant Vestibular Syndromes</h3>

      <p>This is probably why you're on this site. You've read about the HINTS exam, and it's not all that clear to you. Or maybe you hate MRIing every
        single old person with dizziness that shows up in your department. Or maybe you just want to understand dizziness better. You've come to the right place!
      </p>

<p>Acute and Constant dizziness (or "vestibular syndrome") is the main category of people in whom we worry about posterior circulation stroke. That being said,
  in many patients, vestibular neuritis or labrynthitis is likely to be the culprit. So how do we decide who needs an MRI? <strong>The HINTS exam</strong>. It's actually
  better than MRI<sup><a href="http://stroke.ahajournals.org/content/40/11/3504" target="_blank">1</a></sup>! (MRI misses some posterior circulation strokes in the first 48 hours.)
</p>

<p>HINTS consists of three exams, two of which are really straightforward. (The third just takes a little review, which is why I made this site!) It stands for <strong>H</strong>ead <strong>I</strong>mpulse, <strong>N</strong>ys<strong>T</strong>agmus, and <strong>S</strong>kew. For more information
on how to do these exams, <a href="#exam">scroll below</a>. Otherwise, fill out your patient's exam, and we'll help you decide if this is a central or peripheral cause. </p>

<h3>The HINTS Exam Tutorial</h3>

<p>The HINTS exam was developed to help focus on subtle oculomotor neurologic findings that can differentiate central from peripheral acute vestibular syndromes.
It consists of 3 parts, which are shown below with both how to perform the exam as well as examples of exam findings. <strong>Note: This exam takes practice to perform correctly, particularly the first part of the exam, testing head impulse.
Just like any other physical exam manuever, it will get easier with time. A smartphone with a "Slow Motion" video recording option is recommended to help evaluate head impulse testing, especially for beginners.</strong> </p>

<a name="headimpulse_tutorial"></a>
<h4>Head Impulse Testing</h4>

<p>This is the most challenging part of the exam to master. A smartphone with a "Slow Motion" video recording option is recommended to help evaluate nystagmus direction.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>What Is It?</dt>
  <dd>Head Impulse Testing evalutes the brainstem's vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). Normally the vestibular system is able to alert the eyes to head movements so that the eyes can stay fixed on an object even if the head moves rapidly (by moving the eyes in the opposite direction).
    You may have seen "Doll's eyes" — where the patient is comatose, and despite turning the head, the eyes do not move at all. We're looking for signs of the opposite of Doll's eyes: evidence that the <strong>vestibular system</strong> is malfunctioning. </dd>
    <dt>What Am I Looking For?</dt>
    <dd>If the vestibular system is malfunctioning, the patient won't be able to keep up with rapid head movements. You'll see a delay in the tracking, so instead of smoothly seeing the eyes track, you'll see them <strong>jump</strong> sideway to correct and continue tracking.</dd>
    <dt>How Do I Do It?</dt>
    <dd>It's pretty straightforward. You're going to ask the patient to maintain eye contact with you at all times. All you're going to do is quickly turn their head to the left and right randomly and sporadically (so that they can't consciously figure out which way you're about to turn their heads). You can have an assistant record their eyes in Slow Motion and watch it several times.</dd>
    <dt>What are the possible outcomes?</dt>
    <dd>Either one of two things will happen:
      <ol><li>You'll see what you're used to — the same thing you'd see when you look in the mirror. As you turn their head back and forth, no matter the direction, their eyes can smoothly maintain eye contact with you. This suggests that their vestibular system is working just fine, since it's able to coordinate the head movement with the eyes, and suggests that their vertigo may be from a central process.</li>
      <li>Or, you'll see something very strange, where the eyes start going in the same direction you're turning their heads (like Doll's eyes) but then quickly jump back to maintaining eye contact with you. This suggests that their vestibular system is malfunctioning; their eyes jump back to return to eye contact with you, because their brain is working just fine.</li></ol>
</dd>
<dt>Aren't these referred to as "Normal" and "Abnormal" VOR?</dt>
<dd>In the academic literature, yes — the Head Impulse Test evaulates for a "Normal" or "Abnormal" vestibulo-ocular reflex. I've always found these terms confusing when trying to apply them to a patient ("normal" suggests a more sinister cause, "abnormal" suggests a peripheral cause). It's easier to just describe what the eyes do.</dd>
</dl>

<a name="nystagmus_tutorial"></a>
<h4>Nystagmus Testing</h4>

<p>Most physicians are very familiar with checking for nystagmus, but the nuance and subtlety of the exam is the key here: which way does the nystagmus go? Does it always go in that direction, or does it ever switch directions?
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>How Do I Test It?</dt>
  <dd>Simply have the patient focus on your finger, and have them only move their eyes to track your finger. Move it throughout their visual field, in all extremes. Using Slow Motion video recording can sometimes be helpful in this test as well.</dd>
<dt>How Is Nystagmus Described?</dt>
<dd>Nystagmus has a slow deviation phase and a fast correction phase. The nystagmus is named based on the fast phase of the of the nystagmus. So if during the exam, the patient moves their eyes to the left slowly and then they correct to the right, that is "right-beating nystagmus." The same would be with left, up, or down. There is also rotational (torsional) nystagmus.</dd>
<dt>What are the possible outcomes?</dt>
<dd>When the patient follows your fingers, you should be trying to describe the type of nystagmus.
  <ul><li>If it is horizontal, you then want to see if the direction of the nystagmus stays the same no matter the direction they move their eyes. This suggests a peripheral cause of their vestibular syndrome.</li>
<li>Otherwise, you are looking for vertical, rotational, or horizontal nystagmus that changes directions. (In some locations the eyes go fast to the right, in other locations the eyes go fast to the left.) This suggests a central cause of their vestibular syndrome.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>What About Triggered Upbeat-Torsional?</dt>
<dd>This typically suggests <abbr title="Benign Paroxysmal Positioanl Vertigo">BPPV</abbr> — that being said, your patient should be having Triggered symptoms, not acute and constnat symptoms if it is BPPV!</dd>
</dl>

<a name="skew_tutorial"></a>
<h4>Skew Deviation Testing</h4>

<p>Skew Deviation is the easiest exam finding to test but still requires some pratice.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>What is Skew Deviation?</dt>
  <dd>Skew Deviation is when the eyes, when examined separately, cannot maintain appropriate fixation on an object. The eye quickly "deviates" back to a correct position.</dd>
  <dt>How is it performed?</dt>
  <dd>You peform the "Alternate Cover" test. Ask the patient to focus on your nose, and then cover one eye with your hand or a piece of paper. Upon removing your hand and alternating it to the other eye, still having the patient continue looking at your nose, you are looking for one eye to have to correct up or down to regain focus on your nose. If skew deviation is present, one eye will typically have an upward correction, and the other eye will have a downward correction. It is important to alternate eyes multiple times, and focus on the eye that is being uncovered, as the deviation corrects in milliseconds and can be subtle. </dd>
  <dt>What are the possible outcomes?</dt>
  <dd>There are one of two options:
    <ul><li>There will be no correction or skew deviation. This is a normal response and suggests a peripheral cause of the patient's vestibular syndrome. </li>
  <li>If you see any correction, this suggests a central cause. (2% of peripheral vestibular syndromes have skew deviation present as well, but it is such a rare finding that it mandates further investigation with neuro-imaging.)</li>
  </ul>
  </dd>
</dl>
