    <p>Triggered vestibular syndromes make up the vast majority of neurologically dizzy patients.</p>

    <p>The most common of these diagnoses is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benign_paroxysmal_positional_vertigo" target="_blank">benign paroxysmal positional vertigo</a>. About 2.4% of individuals will have BPPV sometime during their lifetime (3.2% in females, 1.6% in males).
      <sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> It is commonly treated pharmaceutically with antihistamine/anticholinergic medicines like meclizine, or benzodiazepenes like lorazepam. It is mechanically treated with canalith repositioning exercises like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4S4CbuN6QA" target="_blank">the Epley manuever</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8ucpWIIC3g" target="_blank">the half-somersault manuever</a> (a modified Epley).
    </p>

    <p>A less common cause of triggered dizziness is orthostatic hypotension, from hypovolemia (dehydration, hemorrhage), autonomic dysfunction, or medications (most classically, alpha-1 blockers). These patients typically become dizzy when going from lying <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> sitting <i class="fa fa-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> standing and improve when they return to a lying position.</p>

    <p>Finally, a rare cause of triggered vertigo is tumor, particularly posterior fossa tumors. These patients often may present with headache and vomiting and typically have had symptoms for weeks-months, as one would expect with a slow-growing intracranial mass.</p>
