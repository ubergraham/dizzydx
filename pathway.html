<h4>
Triggered <i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle" aria-hidden="true"></i>
</h4>


<p class="definition">
Triggered vestibular syndrome describes a patient who has something that <strong>triggers</strong> their dizziness symptoms. They might have zero symptoms at rest or lying still in bed, but when they move their head, this <strong>triggers</strong> their dizziness symptoms to begin or return. Sometimes they have nausea or a milder symptom that persists and muddles the picture, but if they stop moving their head, their dizziness symptoms will resolve completely. (But can be re-triggered by the... trigger.) <strong>Note: This is not the same thing as a certain trigger <em>exacerbating</em> the dizziness.</strong>

<h4>
Episodic <i class="fa fa-adjust" aria-hidden="true"></i>
</h4>


<p class="definition">
Episodic vestibular syndrome describes a patient with dizziness intermittently. They may have very severe symptoms but they come and go -- if their "episode" is resolved when you see them, they should have <strong>no more dizziness</strong>. (Typically their episode has resolved by then time you, the clinician, are seeing them,  and they are not currently dizzy;  <strong>key to your assessment here is the history</strong>).

<h4>
Acute and Constant <i class="fa fa-refresh" aria-hidden="true"></i>
</h4>

<p>
Acute and Constant vestibular syndromes don't come and go. They're present and persistent. They may wax and wane in severity, and they may have a component of position — in that position change may <strong>exacerbate</strong> a patient's symptoms — but this is different than position <em>triggering</em> symptoms that are completely absent until the trigger.

Important DDx Includes:
 </p>
 <ul>
 <li>Vestibular Neuritis</li>
 <li>Labrynthitis</li>
 <li>Posterior Circulation Stroke</li>

        Management Often Includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>MRI neuroimaging for posterior circulation stroke</li>
      <li>Steroids for vestibular neuritis/labrynthitis</li>

<h4>
Mixed or Unclear Dizziness <i class="fa fa-question-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i>
</h4>

<p>
Some patients will simply not fit into a particular category which can significantly challenge the clinician. Most experts recommend using the neurologic exam,
patient age and risk factors for stroke, and overall clinical picture to determine if the patient should receive imaging.   It is always right to do a complete and thorough neurologic exam, and never wrong to consult a neurologist if you have uncertainty, but just can’t fit your patient into one of the syndromes.
