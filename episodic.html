    <p>Episodic vestibular syndromes may present as isolated dizziness, but more often present with other symptoms as well. .</p>

    <p>Arrhythmias can present as episodic dizziness, but often will have additional cardiac symptoms: syncope or near-syncope, palpitations, etc. These patients typically require cardiac evaluation and monitoring.    </p>

    <p>Posterior circulation TIAs can certainly present this way as well, and should be considered in patients with clear episodes of dizziness (and typically with cardiac and/or thromboembolic risk factors).</p>

    <p>Like all migraines, vestibular migraines occur episodically, but will present with dizziness along with headache. They can be treated typical migraine medications.</p>
