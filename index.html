<p>"Dizziness" is estimated to account for 3-4% of all ED visits and 5% of walk-in clinic visits (and some days, it feels like 100%).<sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>From our best research, about 10% of <em>emergency</em> patients have a neurologic cause of their dizziness, and about 25% of <em>those</em> patients (with "acute vestibular syndromes," aka <em>neurologic dizziness</em>) are having a stroke. To translate: If you see 40 dizzy patients in an emergency department, only 4 will actually have a neurologic cause, and only 1 out of those 40 dizzy patients will be having a stroke.<sup id="fnref2:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
<p>It's enough to drive someone mad. The problem, then, is that these stroke patients do poorly – and <em>really</em> poorly when they're missed. The cerebellum swells with edema from the infarct, and then people herniate and die. That's typically frowned upon. <i class="fa fa-frown-o" aria-hidden="true"></i></p>
<p>The other problem, of course, is that dizziness means 30 different things to 30 different people. As we all know, it can mean lightheadedness, near syncope, generalized malaise, vertigo, weakness – and it can be a sign of anything as benign as peripheral
  vertigo to as life threatening as myocardial infarction. It can be ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, brain tumor, urinary tract infection, electrolyte abnormality, hypoglycemia – the differential is honestly probably limitless, given how vague the
  term is. <strong>But don't worry – that's what this site is for!</strong> <i class="fa fa-medkit" aria-hidden="true"></i>
</p>

<p>
  <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> <strong> First off, this site is for the "undifferentiated and isolated dizziness."</strong> It's not for every possible cause of dizziness--it's the dizziness that's not also chest pain, or also diarrhea, or also rash, or also trouble breathing.
  This is slam. Dunk. Dizziness. Got it? Then great.
</p>
<p>
  <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> <strong> Second off, this site is for patients without new focal neurologic deficits.</strong> Hopefully to anyone using this site it is obvious that patients with new focal neurologic deficits and dizziness require emergent imaging and consultation with neurology.
