    <p>Well, you've arrived at the ktichen sink, where all the unclear dizziness goes. Patients may be challenging historians, may have language barriers or different cultural understandings of dizziness, or may simply be unable to express the symptoms they are feeling clearly. </p>
    <p>These patients are often the most challenging to care for as well as evaluate, as we all know the challenges of helping a patient without a clear diagnosis or workup pathway. Most experts would recommend an extremely thorough history and physical exam, (obviously focusing on the cardiac and neurologic examinations) with particular emphasis on ambulation.</p>
    <p>Often these patients are older with significant co-morbidities; lab studies, urinalysis, EKG, and head CT may be normal. There is often little harm in trying low dosages of medicines for dizziness to make the patient feel better.</p>
    <p>If patients are unable to walk because of their continued dizziness, or their gait is unsteady, veering, or ataxic, typically MRI is appropriate, specifically for evaluation of the posterior fossa to assess for posterior circulation stroke, along with neurology consultation and admission to the hospital.</p>
